# Buchnearer
Machine learning dataset for estimating Buchnera population sizes to a higher level of accuracy than gDNA RT-qPCR.

All images are 1D DAPI stained baceriocytes collected by Honglin Feng and Edward B. James of the Wilson lab at the university of Miami.
Segmentation was carried out in label me, before conversion to coco format using labelme2coco.py from Tony067.

Current no. of classes: 1 (buchnera)

Need to add nucleus and bacteriocyte classes for area density metrics.

Any questions, please contact ebj26@miami.edu
